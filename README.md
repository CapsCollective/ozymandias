## BEFORE READING

We're developing this game as an open-source product primarily **for the benefit of other new game developers** who might want to see how we turned our student game into something releasable on Steam.

**If you just want to go play the game, then please support us by purchasing it through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1524530/Fantasy_Town_Regional_Manager/) or [itch.io](https://capscollective.itch.io/ftrm).**

The project is being developed out of our shared passion for putting out cool experiences and is solely being funded by our own blood, sweat, tears, the _continual ritual sacrifice of elves_ and whatever we can get from Steam and itch sales.

## Licence

The game is released under a [modified MIT licensing agreement](LICENCE) (thank you to [DwarfCorp](https://github.com/Blecki/dwarfcorp)). That means all source code is free to use, modify and distribute. However, we have explicitly disallowed modification and redistribution of the following game content (which remains proprietary):

- Images & Textures
- 3D Models
- Sound Effects
- Music
- Writing

No forks, binary redistributions, or other redistributions of this repository may include the proprietary game content. It is up to the redistributor to provide their own game content. "Source code" may also include raw text files, JSON library files, and XML configuration files (which are not considered proprietary "game content") with the explicit exception of those containing "story content" marked as either quests or events.

Basically **we just want to protect the creative content we've worked super hard to produce**, but the engineering work we've done is all free (as in freedom)! We understand it's complicated, so if you have a question about the licensing, please raise an issue on the repository and we can talk it out together.
