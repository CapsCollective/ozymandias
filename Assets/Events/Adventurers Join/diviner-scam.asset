  headline: The Chosen One (of Many)
  article: Three villagers have committed to going on a holy quest after receiving
    pamphlets in the mail, claiming they are the chosen one. The goal of their quest
    is unknown, but involves leaving a portion of their earnings in an unmarked bag
    on the outside of town, and converting as many followers to do the same. The
    origin of these pamphlets are unknown but were sent to nearly every home over
    the night.
