  headline: Taken Too Far
  article: An adventurer, known for acting as the town jester, lost his life last
    night after attempting to perform one of his most famous bits in which he pretends
    to twist his head off. The audience stated that while turning his neck, his last
    words were <i>"Hey guys, watch this"</i>, before realising he may have taken
    it a touch too far.
