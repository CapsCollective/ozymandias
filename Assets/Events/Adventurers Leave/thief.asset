  article: Before riding off, they were sporting a striking new look, adorned in
    several gold chains and a blood red shirt. When asked where they found their
    new look, they joked "I'll never tell" and road quickly into the forest. In other
    news, a number of people were found dead in their homes, the murderer seemed
    to have only taken the deceaseds' jewellery before leaving.
