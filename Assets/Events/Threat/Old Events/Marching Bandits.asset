  headline: The Marching Bandits Finally Strike!
  article: After a series of reports drawing ever-closer to the town, the odd group
    of ruffians known to terrorise their victims with terrible music has finally
    made it here, and have made-off with a king's ransom in loot. They were reported
    heading North, into the mountains.
