  headline: '"I definitely left my stove on, that''s all this was"'
  article: The residence of outspoken <b>dragon</b> denier, Darlon Da'owren, burnt
    down this morning as a winged figure was spotted flying away. He stated that
    he had left the stove on, followed by <i>"and even if it WAS a dragon, our environmental
    impact has nothing to do with their unusually southern migration - there's simply
    no evidence!"</i>
