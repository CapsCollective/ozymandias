  headline: Barracking for the Normal Folks!
  article: "The questing party has returned with the former General, who, while in
    no fighting shape, immediately started criticising the towns \"pathetic excuse
    for a town guard\", and barking orders. His first request is establishing some
    barracks for training. Adventurers are happily going along with this charade,
    at least it'll give them some slightly sturdier cannon fodder."
