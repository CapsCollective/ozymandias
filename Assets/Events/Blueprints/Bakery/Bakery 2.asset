  headline: The Flour Fields
  article: "Our adventurers return today, somewhat disappointed about the misunderstanding
    that has befallen them, finding themselves not in a magical wonderland, but in
    a strange plain filled to the horizon with flour. As it turns out in his daze,
    the man confused the two, and has since vanished from the town. At least this
    means we'll have all the baked goods we could ever need!\r"
