  headline: Adventures Sick of Imported Beer
  article: "A coalition of rowdy adventurers say they are tired of paying extra for
    the tariffs on watered down beer, and want something heartier. After a recent
    mission to an Orc encampment, they found that even THEY have better beer than
    us, and want to organise a mission to steal their designs so we can start brewing
    our own.\r"
