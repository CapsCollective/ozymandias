  headline: Hops to it, Then!
  article: "Returning from the orc camp, the adventurers recount that all seemed
    lost when they were caught and the Orcs started to descend on them. However,
    once they explained they were looking for beer, all hostilities dropped, and
    the Chieftain was more than happy to hand over his personal starter kit and send
    them on their way. They may be bloodthirsty monsters who have waged a ceaseless
    war on us, but they DO respect the art of brewing!\r"
