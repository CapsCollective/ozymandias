  headline: Mime Requests Rescue
  article: "A strange mute walked into the guild hall today with a request. After
    a long drawn out game of charades with the mime it was understood that he is
    part of a circus troupe of street performers. However, his entire troupe has
    been kidnapped, with only him silently escaping. Rescue the troupe and we may
    have a performance in town!\r"
