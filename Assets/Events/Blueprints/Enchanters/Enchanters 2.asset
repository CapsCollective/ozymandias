  headline: No Peace for the Wiccan
  article: 'The mob found the evil witch, and accused her of misdeeds. As it turns
    out, quite the opposite has been happening, and she''s been protecting us this
    whole time. "But if you want me to stop and for the storm clouds to obliterate
    you, I can surely do that". The adventurers quickly backed off. "Good good, now
    here''s some enchantments, go make your weapons nice and strong and leave me
    be" the witch was quoted as the mob started nervously backing off.
