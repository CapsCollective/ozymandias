  headline: Mimics No More!
  article: Our adventurers return from a distress call to a nearby town. Unfortunetly,
    the town was already completely taken over by mimics. "We got there and everything
    was fine until we realised everyone was speaking in unison." At least the adventurers
    burnt down the town before any of them could escape, although the trip home was
    full of shifty eyes.
