  headline: '"Please, Take This Gold!"'
  article: Our adventurers return from the nearby town with pouches full of gold.
    Somehow, a magical portal had opened and was flooding the town with gold pieces,
    which sounded nice at first until the weight started causing the town to sink
    into the ground. Luckily our adventurers closed the portal and helped relieve
    the town of it's gold problem.
