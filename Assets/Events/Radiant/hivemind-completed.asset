  headline: Hysterical Hivemind
  article: 'Our adventurers return from a distress call to a nearby settlement. Unfortunately,
    the camp was already completely taken over by a <b>hivemind</b> that spread from
    a nearby elder-brain.


    "We got there and everything was fine until we realised
    everyone was speaking in unison."


    The adventurers burnt down the town before
    any of them could escape, although the trip home was full of shifty eyes, and
    accusatory <i>''jinxes''</i>.'
