  headline: A Berserking Good Time
  article: Our adventurers have returned from their visit to the <b>viking party</b>.
    It was a great time, but around half-way through all the vikings took a strange
    shot. They began foaming at the mouth and blindly fighting each other. Our group
    decided to leave after it was clear the vikings would deal with themselves.
