  headline: Insane Town Mayor Destroys own Guild Hall
  article: Outrage today, as our iconic town guild hall has been demolished in a
    fit of madness by our newly deposed mayor. Such an insult to the adventurers
    guild has not gone unnoticed, and all support from local adventurers has been
    pulled out of the town. It's only a matter of time now before this place gets
    overrun, and this reporter is getting out of here!
