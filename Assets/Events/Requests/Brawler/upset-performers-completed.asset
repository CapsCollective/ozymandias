  headline: Staged Incompetence
  article: 'A group of brawlers were met with roaring laughter when their attempt
    to stage their own show making fun of the performers ended with forgotten lines,
    collapsing stages and two separate fires. Undeterred, the brawlers were proud
    of their biting satire.


    "They must have loved us! Did you see how much
    they were pointing and laughing?"</i>'
