  headline: The Rogue Who Stole Afternoon Tea
  article: Well known scoundrel, <b>Gorath</b>, made off with the whole town's lunch
    yesterday in an act of whimsical foolishness. The town had gathered for a traditional
    afternoon feast, when their picnic basket of holding had been stolen. In his
    hurried getaway however it appears that Gorath had attempted to hide himself
    inside the basket. Cutting open the container produced countless squished sandwiches
    and the idiot himself, gasping for air.
