  headline: Centaurs in Stable Condition
  article: A group of centaurs have been injured after a late night illegal street
    race ended in a pileup when the centaurs attempted to drift around a corner.
    The recovering perpetrators have been locked in stables, pending a trial, or
    breakout for the sequel. Whichever comes first.
