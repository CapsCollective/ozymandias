  headline: A Slippery Situation
  article: Chaos ensued on the streets today, with townsfolk slipping and sliding
    on a trail of ooze that has been smeared across the city. The trail has been
    traced back to the offices of <i>The Big Boots Gang</i>, who recently returned
    from a successful slime-slaying mission. Unbeknownst to them, as they stomped
    the slimes into submission, their big boots were covered in the thick ichor of
    a job well done. Unfortunately for them, their big boots are in much need of
    a scrubbing down, along with the rest of the city.
