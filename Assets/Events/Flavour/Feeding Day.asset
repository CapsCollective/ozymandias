  headline: Feeding Day is Upon Us!
  article: As it does every year, town prepares for its annual feeding day, when
    townsfolk come together to celebrate the sating of the beast. As is tradition,
    each home leaves a fresh ham upon their doorstep tomorrow night. Residents are
    being urged to purchase their hams quickly to avoid a long and agonising death
    for them and their loved ones this holiday season.
