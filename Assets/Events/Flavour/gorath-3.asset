  headline: Eighth Time's a Charm
  article: Local screw-up, <b>Gorath the Rogue</b>, has fallen into the town well
    for the eighth time this season, once again attempting to pilfer coins after
    mistaking it for a wishing well. Diviners are very angry about having to use
    Gorath-flavoured water in their rituals.
