  headline: Robbery 'Pails' in Comparison
  article: A series of robberies have left shop owners with buckets on heads and
    their stores robbed! How the bucket appeared on their head, and why they didn't
    think to take it off remains a mystery, but when it was finally removed by a
    kindly adventurer, the store was stripped bare. Luckily for the owners (and unluckily
    for the treasury), the shop was completely insured.
