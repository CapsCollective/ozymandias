  article: "A great disturbance to village life yesterday as the goblin alarm was
    raised and a supposed threat was apprehended by town guards, after extensive
    interrogation and scrying village officials came to the conclusion that it was
    in fact not a goblin but instead just a very short, ugly, slightly green man.
    Regardless, he's joined the adventuring guild.\r"
