  headline: Robbery 'Pails' in Comparison
  article: Shopowner with bucket on head gets store robbed! How the bucket appeared
    on their head, and why they didn't think to take it off remains a mystery, but
    when it was finally removed by a kindly adventurer, the store was stripped bare.
    Luckily for the owners (and unluckily for the treasury), the shop was completely
    insured.
