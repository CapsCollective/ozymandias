  headline: '"It''s a very big wall"'
  article: "This morning's town meeting ended as expected with the mayor siding with
    conservationists in an effort to live peacefully alongside the dragon menace.
    The faction proceeded to detail their plan to build a wall to keep the dragons
    out. Many are still wondering how such a wall would stop dragons flying over
    or indeed around it.\r"
