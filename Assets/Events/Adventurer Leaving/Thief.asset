  article: "Before riding off, they were sporting a striking new look, adorned in
    several gold chains and a blood red shirt. When asked where they found their
    new look, they joked \"I'll never tell\" and road quickly into the forest. In
    other news, a number of people were found dead in their homes, the murderer seemed
    to have only taken the deceaseds' jewellery before leaving\r."
