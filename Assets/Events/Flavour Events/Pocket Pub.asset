  headline: Patrons Puzzled by Pocket Pub
  article: "Local tavern, The Drowned Pelican, has called for an investigation following
    a prank that lead to their front door being transmuted into a pocket dimension.
    While the debacle only lasted for 15 minutes before conduits were able to reverse
    the spell, the victims had aged more than 15 years inside a hellish nightmare
    realm where the bard kept playing the same song over again.\r"
