  headline: The Tooth Hurts
  article: "A warning to any parents out there, urge your children against putting
    loose teeth under their pillows for the Tooth fairies. While they seem whimsical
    and wondrous, they are in fact just the larval stage of the far more deadly Bone
    fairy. Hide your teeth! It\u2019s better to starve them before they get too strong.\r"
