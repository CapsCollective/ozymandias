  headline: Something Seams a Little Off
  article: "Scouts caught a mysterious colourful hooved figure prancing through the
    forest in the early hours of the morning. Reports say she was wearing the most
    elegant outfit they have ever seen, yet bolted when the scouts were noticed.
    A red thread from her clothes got caught on a tree, and trails off into the deep
    forest. Why this creature dashed off is unknown, but they Seamstress\u2019ed."
