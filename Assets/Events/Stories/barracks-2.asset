  headline: Lack of Leadership Loses Lives
  article: A member from the commoners guild managed to get an entire adventuring
    party killed earlier today, when their attempt at a heroic charge while yelling
    their name at full volume gave away their position. "If you're gonna be getting
    in our way, least we can do is find you some training!" We've heard of a retired
    general not too far from here that might be willing to get them started.
