Some description...

<!-- DO NOT delete the checklist below, make sure to complete each step after publishing the PR -->
### The PR has been...
- [ ] provided a reasonable name that is not just the branch name (e.g "Added walls mechanic")
- [ ] linked to its related issue
- [ ] assigned a reviewer from the team

### The code has been...
- [ ] made mergable and free of conflicts in relation to `master` *(according to GitHub)*
- [ ] pulled to the reviewer's machine and reasonably tested
- [ ] read through and approved by a reviewer
- [ ] bumped in project version over the [latest release](https://github.com/CapsCollective/ozymandias/releases) (i.e. vX.Y.Z for major, minor or patch)

_Note: for new features, use minor (Y), and for bug fixes or small changes, use patch (Z). Bumping the minor version should also reset the patch version to zero, so v1.2.4, would become v1.3.0. See [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for more info._
